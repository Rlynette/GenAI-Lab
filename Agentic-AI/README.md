# Agentic-AI

This repository contains AI-powered coding tools and projects, with a focus on the Jac programming language and advanced AI assistance for software development.

## Projects

### Aider-Genius
An enhanced version of Aider (AI pair programming tool) specifically adapted for the Jac programming language ecosystem. It introduces **Genius Mode**, a sophisticated agentic workflow for planning, coding, and validating software projects.

See the [Aider-Genius README](./aider-genius/README.md) for detailed information about this project.

### Content Creator
An agentic, modular content creation pipeline built with Jac and Python. This project automates the generation of trending topics, detailed articles, and media assets using a graph-based workflow and multiple specialized agents.

See the [Content Creator README](./content_creator/README.md) for more details.

### Interview Platform
This module provides functionality for generating and managing interview questions for candidates and companies. It includes workflows for orchestrating interviews using Jac.

See the [Interview Platform README](./interview_platform/README.md) for more details.

### JAC GPT
A sophisticated AI chatbot built with Jac that specializes in helping users with Jac programming language questions and Jaseci ecosystem guidance. It features intelligent routing, persistent chat sessions, and a document retrieval system.

See the [JAC GPT README](./jac-gpt/README.md) for more details.

### Task Manager using JIVAS and byLLM
The **Task Manager** is a simple Single-Agentic Application built to demonstrate how agent-based systems can be created in the **Jaseci ecosystem**. It is implemented in two different ways:

- **[JIVAS](https://github.com/TrueSelph/jivas)** – Jaseci’s agent framework
- **[byLLM (Meaning-Typed Programming)](https://www.jac-lang.org/learn/jac-byllm/with_llm)** – a tool-centric agentic framework

See the [Task Manager README](./task_manager/README.md) for more details.

---

### FriendZone - MTP Integrated
A project demonstrating the integration of Meaning-Typed Programming (MTP) for building intelligent, agentic systems.

---

### Jac-MCP Chatbot
A multimodal AI chatbot capable of interacting with documents, images, and videos. It leverages Jac's Object Spatial Programming, Mean Typed Programming, and Model Context Protocol to create a modular and intelligent system.

See the [Jac-MCP Chatbot README](./jac-mcp-chatbot/README.md) for more details.
