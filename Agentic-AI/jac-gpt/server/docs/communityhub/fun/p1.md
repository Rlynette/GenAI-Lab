## Project Idea: Rebuilding Aider with Jac and Agentic Object-Spatial Programming

This project proposes enhancing Aider's architecture using Jac's object-spatial programming paradigm and MTLLM (`by <llm>`) features to optimize multi-file editing, token handling, and repository understanding through graph-based representations.

### Core Concepts

#### Aider's Functionality

Aider assists developers by:

1.  **Understanding Code Structure:** Analyzing the existing codebase to build a mental model.
2.  **Responding to Prompts:** Taking user requests (e.g., "add a new feature," "fix this bug," "refactor this code").
3.  **Generating Code Changes:** Producing code snippets or entire file modifications.
4.  **Applying Changes:** Integrating the generated code into the existing codebase.
5.  **Iterative Refinement:** Allowing users to review, accept, or reject changes, and provide further instructions.

#### Jac's Object-Spatial Programming

In Jac, a codebase can be represented as a graph.

*   **Nodes:** Represent files, classes, functions, variables, comments, and other code constructs. Each node can have properties (e.g., file path, function signature, variable type, code content).
*   **Edges:** Represent relationships between these constructs (e.g., a function `calls` another function, a class `contains` a method, a file `imports` another file, a variable is `defined in` a function).
*   **Walkers:** Can traverse this code graph to understand its structure, identify relevant sections for a given prompt, and even apply modifications.

#### Jac's MTLLM (`by <llm>`)

The `by <llm>` feature allows Jac to delegate complex reasoning and generation tasks to Large Language Models.

*   **Natural Language Understanding:** An LLM can interpret user prompts for Aider.
*   **Code Generation:** An LLM can generate code snippets based on the prompt and the context derived from the code graph.
*   **Decision Making:** An LLM can decide which parts of the code graph are most relevant to a user's request.

#### Understanding Aider's Current Architecture

Aider's success comes from several key architectural decisions:

*   **Tree-sitter Based Repository Map:** Uses tree-sitter to parse source code into ASTs, extracting symbol definitions and references to create a concise map of the codebase.
*   **Graph Ranking Algorithm:** Analyzes dependencies between files as a graph, using ranking algorithms to select the most relevant portions of the repo_map that fit within token budgets (default 1k tokens via `--map-tokens`).
*   **Multiple Edit Formats:** Supports different edit formats (diff, whole, udiff, diff-fenced, editor-*) optimized for different LLM capabilities and use cases.
*   **Architect/Editor Mode:** Separates high-level reasoning (architect) from detailed code editing (editor), allowing optimal model pairing (e.g., o1 + GPT-4o).
*   **Context Management:** Dynamically adjusts repo_map size based on chat state, expanding when no files are in context, contracting when specific files are being edited.
*   **Git Integration:** Automatic commits, diff management, and change tracking through git integration.

#### Jac OSP Value Proposition

Where Jac's Object-Spatial Programming can enhance this proven architecture:

*   **Richer Graph Representation:** While Aider uses file-level dependency graphs for ranking, OSP can represent finer-grained relationships (function calls, variable usage, type dependencies) as first-class spatial relationships.
*   **Advanced Traversal Patterns:** Jac walkers can implement sophisticated traversal algorithms for context gathering that go beyond simple graph ranking.
*   **Multi-File Change Coordination:** OSP's spatial relationships can help ensure consistency across complex refactoring that spans multiple files.
*   **Query-Based Context Selection:** Instead of purely algorithmic ranking, enable semantic queries like "find all functions that handle user authentication" through spatial traversal.
*   **Incremental Graph Updates:** Maintain live graph representation that updates as code changes, enabling more sophisticated change impact analysis.

### Proposed OSP Mode Implementation

Building upon Aider's proven architecture, we propose specific enhancements using Jac's object-spatial programming:

1.  **Enhanced Repository Graph with OSP:**
    *   Extend Aider's existing tree-sitter based repo_map with Jac's spatial graph capabilities.
    *   Create a dynamic, queryable codebase graph where nodes represent code entities (files, classes, functions, variables) and edges represent relationships (calls, imports, dependencies, inheritance).
    *   Use Jac's native graph traversal to optimize the current graph ranking algorithm that selects relevant portions of the repository map.

2.  **Intelligent Context Retrieval with Spatial Walkers:**
    *   Implement specialized walkers that can traverse the codebase graph to gather contextually relevant information.
    *   `ContextGatheringWalker` - navigates from a starting point to collect related code entities based on semantic distance and dependency relationships.
    *   `ImpactAnalysisWalker` - determines which files/functions would be affected by proposed changes.
    *   `DependencyWalker` - maps function call chains and import dependencies for better context understanding.

3.  **MTLLM-Optimized Architect and Editor Pipeline:**
    *   Enhance Aider's existing architect/editor mode with OSP-optimized prompting.
    *   `ArchitectLLM` - analyzes user requests and proposes high-level changes using the spatial graph context.
    *   `EditorLLM` - translates architectural decisions into specific code edits, optimized for Aider's existing edit formats (diff, whole, udiff).
    *   Use Jac's `by <llm>` syntax to create specialized abilities for different aspects of code understanding and generation.

4.  **Enhanced Token Budget Management:**
    *   Implement dynamic token allocation using spatial graph analysis.
    *   `TokenBudgetOptimizer` - walker that prioritizes which parts of the repo_map to include based on relevance scores derived from graph centrality and user context.
    *   Smart context windowing that expands/contracts based on the complexity of the requested changes.

5.  **Multi-File Change Coordination:**
    *   `ChangeCoordinator` - walker that ensures consistency across multi-file edits.
    *   Implements change propagation logic to maintain code integrity across file boundaries.
    *   Validates that changes in one file don't break contracts expected by dependent files.

6.  **OSP-Enhanced Mode:**
    *   Introduce a new `/genius` mode that leverages full OSP capabilities.
    *   This mode builds and maintains a live graph of the codebase, updating it as changes are made.
    *   Provides advanced querying capabilities like "find all functions that depend on this API" or "show me the call chain for this error path".

### Key OSP Optimizations for Aider's Core Components

#### 1. Repository Map Enhancement

### Proposed OSP Mode Implementation

Building upon Aider's existing chat modes (code, architect, ask, help), introduce a new `/genius` mode

#### Integration with Existing Aider Commands

Extend existing commands with spatial awareness:

```bash
# Enhanced /add command with spatial context
/add --spatial file.py  # Automatically add related files based on dependencies

# Enhanced repository understanding
/genius find "error handling"  # Find all error handling code
/genius trace payment_flow     # Trace payment processing dependencies
/genius impact "database schema change"  # Analyze impact of schema changes

# Context expansion based on spatial relationships
/expand --spatial  # Add files related to current context via graph traversal
```

### Expected Benefits and Improvements

#### 1. Better Multi-File Editing
- **Current Issue:** Aider sometimes misses dependent files that need updates when making complex changes
- **OSP Solution:** Spatial traversal ensures all related code is identified and considered
- **Example:** When refactoring an API, automatically identify all client code that needs updates

#### 2. Optimized Token Usage
- **Current Issue:** Fixed token budgets may include irrelevant code or miss important context
- **OSP Solution:** Dynamic context selection based on spatial relevance and user intent
- **Example:** For authentication changes, prioritize auth-related code over unrelated utilities

#### 3. Enhanced Code Understanding
- **Current Issue:** Limited to file-level dependencies and tree-sitter symbol extraction
- **OSP Solution:** Function-level dependencies, usage patterns, and semantic relationships
- **Example:** Understanding that error handling functions are related even across different modules

#### 4. Improved Change Impact Analysis
- **Current Issue:** Manual identification of files that might be affected by changes
- **OSP Solution:** Automated impact analysis using graph traversal
- **Example:** Changing a database model automatically identifies all services, controllers, and tests that use it

### Performance Benchmarks and Metrics

To validate the OSP enhancements, we would measure:

1. **Multi-File Change Success Rate:** Percentage of complex changes that don't require manual fixes
2. **Context Relevance Score:** How often included context is actually used in generated changes
3. **Token Efficiency:** Amount of relevant context per token in the budget
4. **Change Completeness:** Percentage of dependent changes automatically identified
5. **User Satisfaction:** Reduced number of iterations needed to complete complex tasks

### Practical Implementation Strategy
