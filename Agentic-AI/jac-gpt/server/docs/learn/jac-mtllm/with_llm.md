## What is MTP?

Meaning-Typed Programming (MTP) is a programming paradigm that automates LLM integration through language-level abstractions. MTP extracts semantic meaning from code to automatically generate prompts and handle response conversion, reducing the need for manual prompt engineering. These abstractions enable seamless LLM integration by automatically generating prompts from code semantics, making it easier to build agentic AI applications. Additional research details are available on arxiv.org.

The MTP concept is implemented in Jac-lang through the **MTLLM** plugin, which is available as a PyPI package.
